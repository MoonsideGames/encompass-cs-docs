# Encompass

**encompass** is a powerful engine-agnostic framework to help you code games, or other kinds of simulations.

Object-oriented code is messy and rapidly becomes unmaintainable.

encompass lets you write clean, de-coupled code so you can spend more time on your game design and less time fixing bugs.

encompass is currently available with a TypeScript implementation that fully supports transpilation to Javascript and Lua.
A C# implementation is forthcoming.
