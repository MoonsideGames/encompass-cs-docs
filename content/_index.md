# Encompass

[Encompass](https://github.com/encompass-ecs) is a powerful engine-agnostic framework to help you code games, or other kinds of simulations.

Object-oriented code scales and iterates poorly and rapidly becomes unmaintainable.

Encompass lets you write clean, de-coupled code so you can spend more time on your game design and less time worrying about inheritance chains and fixing bugs.

If you are here to learn how to use Encompass and don't care about the justifications for it, or you've never made a game before, I recommend skipping ahead to [Chapter 2](getting_started).
