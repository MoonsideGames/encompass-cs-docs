We have our game loop but there's still ways we could improve our game.

The gameplay is pretty basic right now. We could probably speed it up. Mouse controls would probably feel good. Maybe you could add a human vs human mode.

But you could go even crazier if you wanted.  Why not throw a glow shader on it. Add a four player mode. Or maybe, fuck Pong, you want to make your own game instead of some glorified stuffy 70s arcade game. Go for it! You're the game designer and it's your world.

This tutorial should have given you a pretty good idea of how to build your game simulation in Encompass. If you have suggestions for how the tutorial could be made better, or you have questions about Encompass, or you want to get feedback from other Encompass developers, why not join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZYE88fK)?
