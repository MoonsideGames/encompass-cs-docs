Everyone has played, or at least heard of, Pong. Right? Right...

![pong](/images/pong.png)

Pong was one of the first video games ever created and as such, it is extremely simple, and I think it's a good choice to try re-implementing it in Encompass as an example.

We'll be developing this with the Encompass/LOVE starter pack. Go ahead and [set that up](/getting_started/case_study_love/) if you haven't already so you can follow along. And please do follow along - you can do it!
