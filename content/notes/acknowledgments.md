Special thanks is due to [Mark Kollasch](https://mastodon.technology/@fool) for his insight into the n-pass engine structure and for overall excellent architecture feedback. Many of the ideas in this project were given to me by him.

Thanks to Seiji Tanaka for writing a state machine system with me many years ago and sending me on a long journey of thinking about game architecture.

Thanks to Mitch Gerrard for doing a bunch of graph theory problems with me.

Thanks to the Glitch City LA community for keeping me alive all these years of making games.

Thanks to the creators and maintainers of LÖVE, a wonderful tool which awakened me to the potential joys of game programming.

Thanks to the developers of TypeScriptToLua, an impressive project which unlocked the power of static typing in LÖVE. Encompass-TS would not have been made without it.

My name is Evan Hemsley, and I am a game programmer and digital artist. I hope you make some great projects with Encompass! And if you do, please tell me about them!
