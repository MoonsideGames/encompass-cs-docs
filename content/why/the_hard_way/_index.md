If you're reading this, you have probably been frustrated by code you wrote.

Maybe a feature that you thought would take a few hours took a few days. Or a few weeks.

Maybe a bug you fixed a month ago came back and you can't stand the idea of trying to fix it again.

Maybe you stare at your screen for hours wondering where a new structure could possibly fit into your program.

Maybe you find yourself screaming **WHY!!!!** at your computer and throwing something across the room.

I'm here to tell you that coding a game doesn't have to be this hard.

Just say it with me. *It doesn't have to be this hard.* It doesn't!

The road to recovery starts with some basic structural ideas and a little bit of discipline.

Come along with me, won't you? Let's write some good code.
