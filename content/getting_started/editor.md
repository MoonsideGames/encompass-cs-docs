You will want some kind of text editor to develop Encompass projects.

I _highly_ recommend [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) if you are on Windows or OSX, and Code - OSS if you are on Linux. These are open-source distributions of Microsoft's VSCode editor, which features excellent Typescript integration and various convenient features, like an integrated Git interface and terminal. (Make sure you set the terminal to Git Bash if you are on Windows - this is under File -> Settings.)

Of course, if you prefer some other editor, that will be perfectly fine.
